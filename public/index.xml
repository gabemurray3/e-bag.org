      <description>incomplete Money Making The gist of my money making idea is to make a gaming party bus. This idea was inspired the idea of PCI Passthrough and virtual machine software. I would use server hardware fast enough to run 4 gaming computers at once then have 4 of those servers so I can host 16 gaming players at once.
The 16 players would remotely connect to the server through a LAN wifi connection on a gaming steam deck device that does not run the software directly but uses the steam deck as a screen and controller.</description>

      <description>Writing help An outline of what ideas you want to expand and write about is great for staying on task while writing in general. I use the word &amp;ldquo;expand&amp;rdquo; to emphasize not just having a lot to talk about but having in depth ideas to expand upon through a structured outline.
Outline theme and plan For this outline I will try not to erase anything so that I will have many ideas to bridge.</description>
