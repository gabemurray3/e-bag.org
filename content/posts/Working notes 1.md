# Writing help
An outline of what ideas you want to expand and write about is great for staying on task while writing in general. I use the word "expand" to emphasize not just having a lot to talk about but having in depth ideas to expand upon through a structured outline.

# Outline theme and plan
**For this outline I will try not to erase anything so that I will have many ideas to bridge. The italics text will be stuff that I have deemed not good yet for final products. italic text could also mean not completed writing. I will also use bolded text to show completed text**

# Basic Generic Outline 
first paragraph generic outline that can be used for any mini essay
1. hook
2. background context for topic
3. Transition to thesis 
4. Actual thesis statement
5. Transition for supporting idea 1 

Second paragraph for generic outline
1. topic sentence for supporting Idea 1
2. Transition
3. supporting detail 1
4. Transition
5. supporting detail 2 
6. wrap up and expand why these make sense

**you can repeat the second paragraph's generic outline for other paragraphs.**

my favorite ways of writing is to just start writing without a outline and edit it later so that it makes sense you could use bold and italics text to show emphasis and hash tags for reference 

other tips that might help is to ask questions like the following.

- what will the the audience gain. 
- what action can the reader take today
- what other information can help the reader dive deeper / what are the sources 
- How can I seem urgent 
- How can I incorporate this into my life
- How can I make this more easily read
- How can I retain readers
