# Money Making
The gist of my money making idea is to make a gaming party bus. This idea was inspired the idea of PCI Passthrough and virtual machine software. I would use server hardware fast enough to run 4 gaming computers at once then have 4 of those servers so I can host 16 gaming players at once. 

The 16 players would remotely connect to the server through a LAN wifi connection on a gaming steam deck device that does not run the software directly but uses the steam deck as a screen and controller. 

I would use 4 short throw projectors to set up in the bus to make the setup happen. 

Note: you have to have the capital to buy all these components to the party bus and is recommended to take smaller steps to get started
