# Money Making
The gist of my money making idea is to make a gaming party bus. This idea was inspired the idea of PCI Passthrough and virtual machine software. I would use server hardware fast enough to run 4 gaming computers at once then have 4 of those servers so I can host 16 gaming players at once. 

The 16 players would remotely connect to the server through a LAN wifi connection on a gaming steam deck device that does not run the software directly but uses the steam deck as a screen and controller. 

I would use 4 short throw projectors to set up in the bus to make the setup happen. 

Note: you have to have the capital to buy all these components to the party bus and is recommended to take smaller steps to get started

For this post I want to explain my process of the gaming party bus in sequential steps with limited money to start. 

I will begin with a list of essentials that are needed to build yourself a party bus without the capital to buy a bus and convert all those materials to make a gaming bus. 
# First things first 
The gaming computer and the games. In order to essentially rent these computers out you need these computers in the first place. 
# Beginning with the end in mind 
You need clients to make money you have to put yourself out there to be able to munch off of the abundance that others have in their capital so location and advertising is essential to this business and you must have the time to do these events
